# Determinant-calculator
Utilizing gaussian elimination, this calculator was originally created for a competition focused on speed.


## Usage
It is recommended to call calculateDeterminant() independently to get a determinant calculation. Executing the determinant calculator binary will cause an error unless the competition-specified input is supplied to stdin. 

## IMPORTANT
** The matrix generated from stdin is intentionally not free'd as this is a competition. **
